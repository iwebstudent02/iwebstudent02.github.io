            <h3>Week 4</h3>
            <div class="date">07/05/2019</div>
            <p> This week in class we used adobe xd in order to modify our blog pages
                into lorem ipsum texts. We also began using UI adobe kits in order to get
                ideas or features to our custom UI design.

                    <p>
                        This week we learned how to use photoshop and edit raster images.
                        We used photoshop to make a cleaner image of an illustration and then changed it
                        to a vector SVG using Adobe illustrator. We began learning how to use
                        Adobe Xd which is designing a site without coding. I made a home, about, and Blog page
                        All the pages I made in XD looks like the coded sub pages I made in the first 2 weeks of class.
                        I made a prototype using XD.

                    <h3>Week 2</h3>
                    <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                    <p>I removed all of the CSS that I did last week, and began adding in essential HTML and
                        CSS, such as common structural markup (e.g header, nav, footer, etc.). I also created three
                        category-based lists as the content of my home page. After that I created two sub pages:
                        about.html
                        and blog.html.
                        The About page contains links to the primary resources and technolegies learned in This
                        class. The Blog page contains a brief summary of what I did in class every week, I had a live,
                        working web site with three pages: <a
                            href="https://iwebstudent02.github.io/index.html">Home</a>, <a
                            href="https://iwebstudent02.github.io/about.html">About</a>,<a and
                            href="https://iwebstudent02.github.io/blog.html">Blog</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Week 1</h3>
                    <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                    <p>I learned how to create a live website hosted on github. I first logged into github.com, then
                        I</I>
                    </p>
                    created a root username for a repo as a link to my live website. Named <a
                        href="https://github.com/iwebstudent02/iwebstudent02.github.io">iwebstudent02.github.io</a>
                    After that I used Terminal to copy the repository to my locol desktop (via CLI: git clone). Then I
                    Visual studio code
                    in order to edit the read me file in markdown. Then I created a index.html file, also known as
                    the home page. We also made a style.css file. At the end of every day I saved my changes straight
                    into
                    the server. At the end of the week here's what my site ended up looking
                    <a href="hhtps://iwebstudent02.github.io">https://iwebstudent02.github.io</a> </p>
